# Blackjack

A classic card game where the player competes against the dealer, trying to get a hand with a higher value without going over 21. Push your hand if you think you can get a better score, or stand if you're score is fine as is. Be careful not to go over 21, or you'll bust! Get exactly 21 to get Blackjack! Ran outta cash? Don't worry, our casino is willing to give you a substantial loan... as long as you can earn it back.
