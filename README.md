# Blackjack

A classic card game where the player competes against the dealer, trying to get a hand with a higher value without going over 21. Push your hand if you think you can get a better score, or stand if you're score is fine as is. Be careful not to go over 21, or you'll bust! Get exactly 21 to get Blackjack! Ran outta cash? Don't worry, our casino is willing to give you a substantial loan... as long as you can earn it back.

## Getting Started

- This game can be accessed at https://jkokol2000.github.io/BlackJack/
- The game starts with 1000 chips and the player can place a bet before starting a new hand.
- The player can then hit or stand, and the dealer will play according to the standard rules of blackjack.
- The game will determine the winner and update the player's chips accordingly.
- If the player runs out of chips, they can take a loan of 1000 chips to continue playing, however their winnings will be reduced accordingly
- The game has no real "end", but still has the win/loss entries for the individual games

## Next Steps

- Adding additional options for to make the game closer to BlackJack, such as doubling and splitting hands.
- Change the way the deck shuffle logic works so that the player cannot immediately lose if they bust immediately.
- Improve UI/UX with shuffling animations, better text, and a visual for the dealer.
- Fix the music logic so that it plays on game load, maybe add a menu before game start so that the player interacts with Chrome first.
- Add a storyline (This is more of a personal thing, I think a horror game type thing where you sell your soul if you take too many loans).
