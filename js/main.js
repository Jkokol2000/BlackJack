///Define Important Constants:
//The deck size (likely a variable) 
//The value in which the player/dealer will bust
//The value of an ace (either low or high)
//The value where the dealer will continuously hit until they bust (17)
//How much the player will win in terms of chips
///Define Important Variables:
//The Player’s and the Dealer’s Hand
//The Player’s or Dealer’s Bust status (true or false)
//The Cards currently in deck (Deck will likely be a object with two lists representing suits and card values)
//The player’s Wager and current Balance
///Initialize the board and define the game rules:
//Create a board with the deck in the middle, then allow the player to bet
//The deck is shuffled, then the dealer Deals the cards to player, then dealer, then player, then dealer
//Show the player’s cards, and one of the dealer’s cards
//The player will be able to choose between hitting or staying
//If the player busts, they immediately lose
//If the player stays, the dealer reveals their other card, then takes cards until their hand equals 17 or more
//If the dealer busts or has a hand worse than the player’s, the player wins
//If the dealer has a better hand or blackjack, the dealer wins
//If the hand’s values are equal, a “push” happens (essentially a tie)
//The cards are then retrieved, the deck is shuffled, and the player is able to choose to bet again to start a new game. 
//If their balance is 0, they are able to click a “loan” button, giving them more chips but reducing their “winnings” by a considerable amount.
